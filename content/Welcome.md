The Workshop on **Computer Vision for Microscopy Image Analysis (CVMI)** will be held on July 1th, 2016 in conjunction with the [CVPR 2016](http://cvpr2016.thecvf.com) conference.

This workshop will bring together computer vision experts from academia, industry, and 
government who have made progress in developing computer vision tools for microscopy 
image analysis. It will provide a comprehensive forum on this topic and foster in-depth 
discussion of technical and application issues. It will also serve as an introduction to 
researchers and students curious about this important and fertile field.
